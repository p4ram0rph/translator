<h1>The live translator</h1><hr><br><br>
<span>
This was the project i did for Trinity Colleges bridge27 program it uses ibms watson api and yandexes translate api to translate text as you speak
It isnt perfect since i literally wrote it in a day 
and the files record1.py and record.py were copy and pasted from stack overflow but when i had trouble using pyaudio module on the raspberry pi
i decided to use arecord instead and aplay :D
